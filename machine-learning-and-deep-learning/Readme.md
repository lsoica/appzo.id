# Intro

Deep learning is a subcategory of machine learning that uses neural networks. It is used to solve problems in computer vision, natural language processing and speech recognition.

Machine learning solves problems differently with structured data than with unstructured data.

For structured data:
 - Random forest
 - Gradient boosting
 - Naive Bayes
 - Nearest neighbors
 - Support vector machines (SVM)
 - etc

For unstructured data, the most common approach is to use neural networks:
 - Fully connected network (FCN)
 - Convolutional neural network (CNN)
 - Recurrent neural network (RNN)
 - Transformers
 - etc
